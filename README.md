Using whatever JavaScript tools and libraries you prefer, create a simple slider that contains 5 images that are read from an array of links. The slider must slide, and not fade. Important: Add comments to every function and / or section of code you create (Do not use pre-built solutions from CodePen, etc.) Once completed, add the slider project to a public Git repo
